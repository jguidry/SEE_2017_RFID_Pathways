TODOs::


#Goal for next Friday: get video working and audio with total scan system working



-Think of ways to "extend the visit / stay in contact"

-Look into email option --> extending the visit
  (contingent on us storing emails)

-Research Facebook / social media sharing option
    --> Look into "login with Facebook"??

-Record user data
    --> create space in database for stats??

-Determine what kind of data we can/will store in database
  (Following ucsd guidelines or something)







-offline redundancy / online revert




-Go to correct page based off of language & education for Pathways
-Single html page with preferences loading correct image Architecture
    -->Create js file that contains the code to load correct image from file system
    when we get to PathwayXXX.html --> onload vs onpageshow

-"deeper Dive" perspective change (Maybe)
    -->redirect buttons on every page --> their info has to allow space for it
        or we need to find discreet button --> dropdown menu? only a single thing



-Change/Add fields to registration (UPDATE OTHER TEAM'S WORK)
-Integration testing with Kiosk



-Update code base for easy maintenance and updatability and overall robustness




-PLACE ALL FILES INTO CORRECT DIRECTORIES (MVC approach?)




STAY CONSISTANT WITH REQUIREMENTS DOC



-Work on update system
-Updating system
  --> get file upload working for images, then continue
  --> get audio / videos to work
  --> link to OTHER TEAM Employee portal (MAYBE)
-play audio / video clip from browser in general




Security::
-parse user inputs
-LAN connecting to database
